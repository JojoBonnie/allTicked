# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to deepen my understanding of web application development and refine my skills in  
Python and the Django framework. To achieve this, I created **allTicked**, a task management app designed to help users organize their work, boost productivity, and stay on track.

In **allTicked**, users can create projects, add tasks with due dates and priority levels, assign tasks to collaborators, and mark them as completed (“ticked”). The interface includes a clean task board, intuitive workflows, and a progress tracker to visualize project completion. This app is ideal for individuals, small teams, and anyone looking for a simple and effective way to manage daily tasks.
